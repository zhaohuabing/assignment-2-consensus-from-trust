This repo is the consensus-from-trust programming assignment practice of "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" online course.

This amazing course is created by the professors of Princeton University. It's free on the internet. The course has a series of well-organized lecture videos and programming practices after each lecture. I encourage anyone who is interested in cryptocurrency to attend this travis-ci onlie course. You will get a chance to learn the theories and technical details behind the popular Bitcoin and may even create your own version of cryptocurrency after finishing this course!
